DESCRIPTION:"In the era of containers and other dynamic platforms, management of entry points is becoming a great challenge,with the large amounts of application deployments requiring entry points to update often.  And the patterns for routing, blue / green or canary, are challenging to scale.  You want secured HTTPS requests on your applications, while ensuring certificates are up to date on these ephemeral URLs,thus requiring a lot of plumbing.  Learn how to overcome this complexity, and successfully build reliable entry points, focusing your energy on what matters to you.  Our session will define what a modern edge router, reverse proxy and load-balancer are, from Traefik;s point of view.  We will then present concepts and advanced features which overcome the platform entry point challenges.  And finally, we'll dig deeper and show how we can scale these solutions and make them fault tolerant.  We look forward to the Q & A section and chatting those who have questions around dynamic configuration,Ingress Controllers and with those who wish to learn how Traefik helps developers build the best infrastructure with ease.

DESCRIPTION:"When you're managing distrubyted applications you're probably using a variety of tools that serve specific purposes.  Terraform, Helm, Compose, CloudFormation, Pulumi, ARM templates, etc. No one tool solves all your needs.  And new tools come along regularly. But all tools tend to invent there own packaging.  In this talk we'll introduce the Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB) specification, and some associated tooling.  CNAB embraces the multi-tool world and allows for packaging up multiple formats and their accompanying toolchains into a single artefact.  Imagine a single installable package that contains Terraform code to launch an RDS instance and a Compose file orHelm charts describing the application that will use it.  Today you might package and distribute those separately, with CNAB you can keep them together.  That means we can share metadata, cryptographically sign a single artefact, push all aspects of the application to a central registry and more.  In this talk we'll introduce CNAB, discuss some of the problems it solves, and show demos of the accompanying tooling.  "

DESCRIPTION:"Choria is a 2 year old project that started life as an easy route to using MCollective for open source Puppet users.  It has evolved to encompass a number of technologies related to large scale systems managementand have been deployed on globe spanning sites with 100s of thousands of nodes and thousands of daily active users.  This talk will give an update on the projects status, progress, and will explore some of the new technologies created in this project.  With the arrival of Puppet 6 in fall 2018 Puppet Inc has officially deprecated The Marionette Collective andhave donated the legacy MCollective code bases to the Choria project.  We will explore what options Puppet 6 users have for benefiting from their past investments in the MCollective platform andlook at work done that will be of particular interest to Puppet users such as orchestrating nodes using the Puppet DSL using Choria Playbooks.

DESCRIPTION:"Have you longed for a simple yet powerful way to automate workloads on Kubernetes?  Ansible, the familiar IT automation tool, makes it easier than ever to automate your cluster.  This talk introduces two practical ways to define and provision complex applications using Ansible Automation with Kubernetes.    The Automation Broker allows users to leverage Ansible Automation to define and orchestrate applications,making them available for self-service provisioning in the Service Catalog.

DESCRIPTION:"This talk will show a uncommon case study for Foreman at NETWAYS.  Our training schedule is fully packed with public and in-house training courses andhaving many different topics requires us to change training environments quite often andin short time to get them to different locations.  Moving away from golden images to Foreman and Puppet has enabled our Events team to provision training environments independently from technical stuff.  The Discovery Plugin allows to use the same process for handling rental notebooks for in-house training courses and big conference.  Virtual machines for the training labs have gone from manual provisioning through managed by Foreman to Vagrant to get even more flexibility.  And the latest step to reduce the need for re-provisioning is by using LVM snapshots and downloading Virtual Machine images from the cloud.  "

DESCRIPTION:"Unikernels are a new class of operating system.  The core idea is to merge the kernel, libraries, and application into a single image binary, operating in a single address space.  This has the potential to improve security, performance, and a few other factors.  For native Unikernel applications, this moves configuration to the build stage.  So how are we supposed to manage these applications?  How should they be configured and deployed?  How can we profile them?  Debug them?   The talk will start with what a Unikernel is, an overview of the Unikernel landscape and their different characterist.  Where are they heading?  An interesting development is happening with Unikernels sneaking their way onto Linux systems and playing hand-in-hand with more traditional systems.  I'll demo a couple of Unikernel applications.  Show how they are configured and deployed.  What tools exist and what tools are missing.  A bit of talk about the joys and pains of deploying an untested class of operating systems in production.  Open questions for which I have no answers but will solicit feedback are:- What existing tools could be used to manage this class of applications?- What class of problems matches the characteristics of Unikernels (Real-time, immutable, small)"

DESCRIPTION:"To borrow a phrase, "In the beginning was the command line." Then we had ISConf and CFEngine, and things were good... for a while.  Puppet and Chef came along, embodying the idea that infrastructure code should behave like application code.  More recently, Ansible brought the concept of idempotent resources to imperative workflows, but stops short of modelling in favor of radical simplicity.  Now we're wondering: is it possible to get the best of both worlds?  Can we get model-based guarantees plus orchestrated action?  I think the answer is "yes" and in this talk I will explore an emerging "fourth generation" of config management tools that attempt to bring the beneficial properties of models together with orchestrated action. In full disclosure, I'll talk about Puppet's Bolt and Lyra projects, but the talk will not be vendor-specific as tools like Terraform and OpsMop also exemplify this approach."

DESCRIPTION:"Kubernetes in general, and Istio in particular, have changed a lot the way we look at Ops-related constraints: monitoring,load-balancing, health checks, etc.Before those products became available, there were already available solutions to handle those constraints.  Among them is Hystrix, a Java library provided by Netflix.  From the site: "Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems,services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable."  In particular, Hystrix provides an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern,which prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other services. But now Istio also provides the same capability.  In this talk, we will have a look at how Istio and Hystrix implement the Circuit Breaker pattern, and what pros/cons each of them has.  After this talk, you'll be able to decide which one is the best fit in your context.  "

No, really. Not on the agent.  And that's still true.  Because running functions on the master means that the catalog is a complete representation of the state we want on the node.  But... sometimes there are things that we just can't put in the catalog, or have to be computed on the agent.  Puppet 6 introduces the concept of Deferred functions, to be run during the catalog enforcement.  In this talk I'll show how that can be used to manage secrets on the node, without the master ever knowing those secrets.  I'll also walk through the process of updating my popular node_encrypt module, which encrypts secrets as they pass through the catalog,to use Deferred functions to decrypt those secrets agent side, vastly broadening its capabilities.

Situations arise like log files filling up disks,failed login attempts that could be brute force attacks,and unwanted processes and services running.  Using the Beacon system of SaltStack, we can monitor a system for these & other scenarios.  Pairing this with the Reactor system, we can have SaltStack remediate those systems to the desired state.  In this talk, we'll look at some real-life examples if these scenarios and how Saltstack can help to automatically heal the systems.  The talk will include:- A brief introduction to Salt Stack.- Using Salt Beacons to monitor aspects of a system.- Using Salt Reactors to react to events from the Salt Beacons.- Using those reactors to remediate issues as they occur."

For our human eyes, it should have a clear design that allows for easy understanding and maintenance.  Rudder offers many options to express little details in the policy.  We need to find a best practice for quickly choosing the simplest option, which is least likely to require redesign.  ### Experiences ###- managing kernel module blacklists, managing sysctls- configuring auditd to be safe and lightweight- mixing globally applicable and os-specific Rudder rules- using ncf sys knowledge to abstract OS-specific package and service names out of the policy- independent testing of compliance using Lynis and monitoring** why? because if we (flawed human) design the policy, we (same flawed human) should not design the final test :-) **### Takeaway ###We'll wrap it up with practical stuff like configuring OSSEC and why nsjail is awesome as a containment technology for services.

DESCRIPTION:"An overview over InnoGames infrastructure and the tools we build.  At InnoGames we have to keep track of three collocations,~30 racks with thousands of VMs to run games for over 200 million registered users.  We have to manage our self hosted as well as various external services and preferably do so in a way that does not wake our oncall admin at 3am.  All our infrastructure is configured via a central configuration management database.  We use that database to keep track of physical and virtual machines, network equipment and configuration, monitoring and much more.  We have open sourced our configuration management database [0], as well as our tooling for managing KVM VMs [1].

DESCRIPTION:"More and more services expose their state, internal details and metrics to be observable, and improve overall quality of service.  But what about observing the infrastructure they are deployed, configured and maintained on?

DESCRIPTION:"After almost a year of running Openshift Origin in production we decided to migrate to a vanilla Kubernetes setup and during this phase we had to take some hard decisions:- - we focused our approach on control: we switched from using the tools provided by the community, like ansible or kops, to writing puppet manifests;- - we challenged the necessity of some features: this allowed us to simplify the setup, reuse tooling/systems from bare-metal infra and have directly addressable pods;- - we focused on monitoring and observability: we defined relevant SLOs and wrote custom probes (unit and integration tests) verifying the user experience.This talk shows the reasons, benefits and some of implementation details of these decisions."

DESCRIPTION:"What is it like to start new in infrastructure management land coming from development/qa/release background?- How do you wrap your head into infrastructure as code when all you cared before was if your code compiles?- How do software development techniques translate to infrastructure management?I started my first job as an operations engineer 18 months ago andI had all of those questions and many more.  Coming from development background the transition into a more ops role anda DevOps team has been a fascinating journey.  I'd like to share the lessons I learned along the way and encourage more people to blur the traditional lines.  "

DESCRIPTION:"RFC-1 was published 50 years ago.  Infrastructure management emerged as a discrete field two decades later, and devops a decade after that.  As we work to realize the full potential of networked computing and the decentralized organizations it enables, what will the next 50 years bring, and what can we do to hurry things along?In this talk, we’ll touch on some of the roots of current infrastructure management tools and the motivation and computing science theory behind them.  We'll attempt to reconcile some long-lasting disconnects by referring to current thinking in distributed consensus systems.  Finally, we’ll (carefully) extrapolate forward to see what the community likely will be working on between now and mid-century, and we’ll announce some new initiatives in that direction."
