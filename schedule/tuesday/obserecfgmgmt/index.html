Technically, he intervenes in particular on the scalability and performance aspects of the solution, as well as on the interconnection between the policy engine and the agent.</p><p>Before founding Rudder, Nicolas explored many fields as a developer and integrator, from very low level hardware (hard disk emulation in FPGA) to neural networks.</p><p>In his spare time, Nicolas is a happy but sometimes tired father, a former Salsa dancer, and an alternative music lover.</p></div></div></section><footer><div>CfgMgmtCamp is a free open source event.
