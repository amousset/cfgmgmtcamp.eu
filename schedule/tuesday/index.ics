SUMMARY:Battle of the circuit breakers: Istio vs Hystrix

DESCRIPTION:"Kubernetes in general, and Istio in particular, have changed a lot the way we look at Ops-related constraints: monitoring,load-balancing, health checks, etc.Before those products became available, there were already available solutions to handle those constraints.  Among them is Hystrix, a Java library provided by Netflix.  From the site: "Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems,services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable."  In particular, Hystrix provides an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern,which prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other services. But now Istio also provides the same capability.  In this talk, we will have a look at how Istio and Hystrix implement the Circuit Breaker pattern, and what pros/cons each of them has.  After this talk, you'll be able to decide which one is the best fit in your context.  "

DESCRIPTION:"For a long time now, a common refrain in the #puppet IRC and now Slack channels has been explaininghow Puppet functions run during compilation on the master and not on the agent.  No, really. Not on the agent.  And that's still true.  Because running functions on the master means that the catalog is a complete representation of the state we want on the node.  But... sometimes there are things that we just can't put in the catalog, or have to be computed on the agent.  Puppet 6 introduces the concept of Deferred functions, to be run during the catalog enforcement.  In this talk I'll show how that can be used to manage secrets on the node, without the master ever knowing those secrets.  I'll also walk through the process of updating my popular node_encrypt module, which encrypts secrets as they pass through the catalog,to use Deferred functions to decrypt those secrets agent side, vastly broadening its capabilities.

DESCRIPTION:"As the number of servers that we are responsible for increases,the ability to manage issues on those systems becomes more and more difficult.  Situations arise like log files filling up disks,failed login attempts that could be brute force attacks,and unwanted processes and services running.  Using the Beacon system of SaltStack, we can monitor a system for these & other scenarios.  Pairing this with the Reactor system, we can have SaltStack remediate those systems to the desired state.  In this talk, we'll look at some real-life examples if these scenarios and how Saltstack can help to automatically heal the systems.  The talk will include:- A brief introduction to Salt Stack.- Using Salt Beacons to monitor aspects of a system.- Using Salt Reactors to react to events from the Salt Beacons.- Using those reactors to remediate issues as they occur."

However, the common question or struggle is how to achieve that.  This talk presents multiple approaches and patterns with their advantages and disadvantages,so you can pick the one that fits your organization best:- Parse: Take the log files of your applications and extract the relevant pieces of information.- Send: Add a log appender to send out your events directly without persisting them to a log file.- Structure: Write your events in a structured file, which you can then centralize.- Containerize: Keep track of short lived containers and configure their logging correctly.- Orchestrate: Stay on top of your logs even when services are short lived and dynamically allocated on Kubernetes.Each pattern has its own demo with the open source Elastic Stack (previously called ELK Stack),so you can easily try out the different approaches in your environment.  Though the general patterns are applicable with any centralized logging system.  "

DESCRIPTION:"### Intro ###We're working to put in place a Rudder policy that covers all OS that we support at our customers,or that will be coming around (i.e. beta of a new version).  For our managed systems, it should cover distro-/OS-specific settings and that "what makes sense everywhere, will be applied everywhere".  For our human eyes, it should have a clear design that allows for easy understanding and maintenance.  Rudder offers many options to express little details in the policy.  We need to find a best practice for quickly choosing the simplest option, which is least likely to require redesign.  ### Experiences ###- managing kernel module blacklists, managing sysctls- configuring auditd to be safe and lightweight- mixing globally applicable and os-specific Rudder rules- using ncf sys knowledge to abstract OS-specific package and service names out of the policy- independent testing of compliance using Lynis and monitoring** why? because if we (flawed human) design the policy, we (same flawed human) should not design the final test :-) **### Takeaway ###We'll wrap it up with practical stuff like configuring OSSEC and why nsjail is awesome as a containment technology for services.  We can help our colleagues and ourselves securing many applications, with a much better learning curve than SElinux etc. got.  So when you walk in the room and listen you get rough idea of sustainable policy design but also of what a sec policy looks like,if it's not only made to fill a checklist.  "

DESCRIPTION:"An overview over InnoGames infrastructure and the tools we build.  At InnoGames we have to keep track of three collocations,~30 racks with thousands of VMs to run games for over 200 million registered users.  We have to manage our self hosted as well as various external services and preferably do so in a way that does not wake our oncall admin at 3am.  All our infrastructure is configured via a central configuration management database.  We use that database to keep track of physical and virtual machines, network equipment and configuration, monitoring and much more.  We have open sourced our configuration management database [0], as well as our tooling for managing KVM VMs [1].  What makes serveradmin unique is how easy it is to modify the database schema as well as its very easy to use and fast API.  This talk will:- give you an overview over our infrastructure and custom tooling.- explain our approach to API driven infrastructure automation.- show you how to model your infrastructure in serveradmin.- demonstrate creation, deletion and live migration of KVM VMs.[0] https://github.com/innogames/serveradmin[1] https://github.com/innogames/igvm"

Here, they find themselves expected to act as part of a classic multi-tier support structure,with at least part of their time spent acting as a 3rd line support function.  This presentation explores the problems this creates:its siloed nature creates inefficient work-in-progress queues,and reduces cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing.  Service Management plays a vital role in managing system consumers at scale,but it needs to modernise to work well in the new era.  Hence, this presentation explores emergent methods such as Swarming,and new thinking such as Cynefin, which bring new thinking and new structures which align much better to modern development and operations thinking.

With beaker and its plugins we can write acceptance tests with powerful assertions using serverspec on actual throw away machines.  This is the easiest way to guarantee your PRs don't introduce regressions.  It can also be used during development to verify functionality.  In this talk we'll go over the basics of how to set up the boiler plate, write tests, easily (re)run them during development and use it in your CI.

DESCRIPTION:"More and more services expose their state, internal details and metrics to be observable, and improve overall quality of service.  But what about observing the infrastructure they are deployed, configured and maintained on?  What can we learn from that, and what do we need from configuration management to get these features and metrics?  Logs from installation is a good start, but they need centralization, aggregation and especially knowledge derivation from these -but also we need to observe these features over time, to trace changes, and correlate them with monitoring.

DESCRIPTION:"After almost a year of running Openshift Origin in production we decided to migrate to a vanilla Kubernetes setup andduring this phase we had to take some hard decisions:- we focused our approach on control: we switched from using the tools provided by the community, like ansible or kops, to writing puppet manifests;- we challenged the necessity of some features: this allowed us to simplify the setup,reuse tooling/systems from bare-metal infra and have directly addressable pods; - we focused on monitoring and observability:we wrote custom probes (unit and integration tests) verifying first the user experience monitored with SLOs.  This talk shows the reasons, benefits and some of implementation details of these decisions."

DESCRIPTION:"The abstraction layer for Configuration Management is moving away from the operating system to the orchestration layer,but the configuration management tools aren't keeping up.  As the number of Kubernetes clusters you run grows,your ability to install components on them with slight and subtle differences becomes more and more manual.  kr8 is designed to take the heavy lifting out of this,by allowing you to manipulate yaml with a first class data templating language (jsonnet) without all the overhead of similar tools.  It follows the principles of simplicity you'd expect from a bunch of admins writing a tool,while still allowing the power and flexibility to get what you need done.  This talk will go over the inspiration behind kr8,as well as show a practical demo and example of deploying the componentsyou choose to multiple clusters with the modifications needed in a few lines of code.

Infrastructure as code means that you are supposed to use a programming language because otherwise, it won't work.  Some YAML evangelists will tell you that a "human-friendly data serialization standard" is better than codebecause it will keep you out from writing weird and wrong code that you are not supposed to write doing infrastructure.  The truth is that you need to code better! At InfluxData we know that,and this talk is about our journey moving from YAML to Go to manage our Kubernetes cluster.

DESCRIPTION:"What is it like to start new in infrastructure management land coming from development/qa/release background?- How do you wrap your head into infrastructure as code when all you cared before was if your code compiles?- How do software development techniques translate to infrastructure management?I started my first job as an operations engineer 18 months ago andI had all of those questions and many more.  Coming from development background the transition into a more ops role anda DevOps team has been a fascinating journey.  I'd like to share the lessons I learned along the way and encourage more people to blur the traditional lines.  "

SUMMARY:100 years of infrastructure: A future history

DESCRIPTION:"RFC-1 was published 50 years ago.  Infrastructure management emerged as a discrete field two decades later, and devops a decade after that.  As we work to realize the full potential of networked computing and the decentralized organizations it enables, what will the next 50 years bring, and what can we do to hurry things along?In this talk, we’ll touch on some of the roots of current infrastructure management tools and the motivation and computing science theory behind them.  We'll attempt to reconcile some long-lasting disconnects by referring to current thinking in distributed consensus systems.  Finally, we’ll (carefully) extrapolate forward to see what the community likely will be working on between now and mid-century, and we’ll announce some new initiatives in that direction."
