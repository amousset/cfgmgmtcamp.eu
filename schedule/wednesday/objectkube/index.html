Calvin leads field engineering and delivery in EMEA for Canonical, helping companies deploy and operate OpenStack and Kubernetes efficiently at scale. Mark leads Ubuntu.
Kubernetes is central to future automation and operations at the application layer across multiple cloud environments. It is an open community that is expanding very rapidly to embrace new capabilities and integrate with new services. That makes it challenging to operate efficiently, because the pace of change, the scale, and the complexity of user requirements all combine to make it difficult to keep up especially when one is trying to do it in a multi-cloud world taking advantage of the unique features in each public cloud.
Calvin and Mark will work through the details of deploying Kubernetes, integrating it with various company systems, integrating it with cloud-specific LBAAS and identity, scaling it, and upgrading it.
By the end of the tutorial you should be confident to deploy K8s in multiple different on-prem or cloud environments, taking advantage of sophisticated features, and offering your own CAAS to customers and users with high availability and a guarantee of free upgrades as and when they want them."><meta name=twitter:image content=https://cfp.cfgmgmtcamp.be/uploads/4c638f062be22251bf187711ae7bd0b30bbf628ff3b618fe04.jpeg><meta name=twitter:image:alt content="Mark Shuttleworth"><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Chivo:900" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400,600" rel=stylesheet><link href=/css/leaflet.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link href=/css/reset.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link href=/css/stylesheet.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css media=screen><link href=/css/pygment_trac.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css media=screen><link href=/css/print.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css media=print><link href=/css/schedule.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link href=/css/schedule-single.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link href=https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.6.3/css/all.css rel=stylesheet><link rel="shortcut icon" href=favicon.ico><script src=/js/leaflet.min.js></script><title>Multi-cloud and on-prem Kubernetes with Object Oriented Operations</title></head><body><nav><a href=# id=menu-icon>&#x2261;</a><ul><li><a href=/><img src=/images/logo_top.png alt=CfgMgmtCamp></a></li><li><a href=/about/>About</a> |</li><li><a href=https://registration.cfgmgmtcamp.be/ghent/2019/>Registration</a> |</li><li><a href=/sponsors/>Sponsors</a> |</li><li><a href=/location/>Location</a> |</li><li><a href=/schedule/>Schedule</a> |</li><li><a href=/fringes/>Fringe</a> |</li><li><a href=/speaker/>Speakers</a> |</li><li><a href=/codeofconduct/>Conduct</a> |</li><li><a href=https://archive.cfgmgmtcamp.eu/>Archive</a> |</li></ul></nav><section id=talk><div id=talk><h1>Multi-cloud and on-prem Kubernetes with Object Oriented Operations</h1><h2><a href=/speaker/markshuttleworth>Mark Shuttleworth</a> <span style=font-size:1em><a href=https://twitter.com/sabdfl><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>@sabdfl</a></span></h2><h3><a href=https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/room/4.kubernetes/></a>-
