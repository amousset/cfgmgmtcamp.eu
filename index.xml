Among them is Hystrix, a Java library provided by Netflix.
From the site: &amp;ldquo;Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.</description></item><item><title>CNAB: packaging for distributed applications with multiple toolchains</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/cnab/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/cnab/</guid><description>When you&amp;rsquo;re managing distrubyted applications you&amp;rsquo;re probably using a variety of tools that serve specific purposes.
Terraform, Helm, Compose, CloudFormation, Pulumi, ARM templates, etc. No one tool solves all your needs.

No, really. Not on the agent.
And that&amp;rsquo;s still true.
Because running functions on the master means that the catalog is a complete representation of the state we want on the node.

The user experience and interface considerations for a tool as technical and complex, and with such potential to break things as a configuration management tool are certainly a challenge, and in some ways in unchartered territory. Rudder&amp;rsquo;s frontend developer will present an analysis of the situation, the issues encountered and the approach adopted for the improvement of UX and UI planned for 2019.</description></item><item><title>Using acceptance tests for better Puppet modules</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/puppetaccept/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/puppetaccept/</guid><description>Using rspec-puppet to write module tests is also very common.
Most of us also use rspec-puppet-facts to test with the correct OS facts.
These are all good tools and every Puppet module author should know them.
Writing acceptance tests is a lot less known.
With beaker and its plugins we can write acceptance tests with powerful assertions using serverspec on actual throw away machines.
This is the easiest way to guarantee your PRs don&amp;rsquo;t introduce regressions.</description></item><item><title>What happened in Rudder in 2018 and what&#39;s next?</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/ruddernext/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/ruddernext/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at Rudder&amp;rsquo;s new features from 2018, both in terms of the features of versions 4.3 and 5.0 as well as the new documentation and our platform for building and distributing binaries.

It has been around for more than six years and has users large (think 10 000 nodes) and small around the world.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a moment to look at the vision that lead us here, how Rudder is different from similar tools, and what users find invaluable, nice (or annoying - I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest!</description></item><item><title>What uses for observing operations of Configuration Management?</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/obserecfgmgmt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/obserecfgmgmt/</guid><description>More and more services expose their state, internal details and metrics to be observable, and improve overall quality of service.
But what about observing the infrastructure they are deployed, configured and maintained on?
What can we learn from that, and what do we need from configuration management to get these features and metrics?
Logs from installation is a good start, but they need centralization, aggregation and especially knowledge derivation from these - but also we need to observe these features over time, to trace changes, and correlate them with monitoring.</description></item><item><title>Atix</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/sponsors/atix/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/sponsors/atix/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Benefits of taking the less traveled road</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/roadtravel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/roadtravel/</guid><description>After almost a year of running Openshift Origin in production we decided to migrate to a vanilla Kubernetes setup and during this phase we had to take some hard decisions:
- we focused our approach on control: we switched from using the tools provided by the community, like ansible or kops, to writing puppet manifests; - we challenged the necessity of some features: this allowed us to simplify the setup, reuse tooling/systems from bare-metal infra and have directly addressable pods; - we focused on monitoring and observability: we defined relevant SLOs and wrote custom probes (unit and integration tests) verifying the user experience.</description></item><item><title>Chef and the Microsoft Ecosystem, Engineering Update</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/mschef/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/mschef/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2019 and at Chef we&amp;rsquo;ve been busy building new tools and integrations, as well as improving our existing open source software with the help of the community.

Security compliance is a state where computer systems are scrutinized against certain defined security policy.
OpenSCAP is one such security compliance ecosystem that provides multiple tools to assist administrators and auditors with assessment, measurement, and enforcement of security baselines.
Foreman provides OpenSCAP as a plugin that enables Foreman to receive automated vulnerability assessment and security compliance audits from Foreman hosts.</description></item><item><title>Example42</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/sponsors/example42/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/sponsors/example42/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Inside the Secret Sauce Laboratory: Rethinking SSL in Puppet</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/sslsauce/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/sslsauce/</guid><description>Puppet 6 made a number of changes to the PKI / certificate layer that fix longstanding problems and add awesome new features.

It is focused on best-practice cluster security, management and operation.
This talk will clarify the reasoning behind creating Tarmak, the architecture and technologies used.
With Tarmak we tried to not reinvent the full wheel, that is why we have chosen to depend on a lot open-source tools (Terraform, Puppet, Vault, &amp;hellip;).

As the number of Kubernetes clusters you run grows, your ability to install components on them with slight and subtle differences becomes more and more manual.
kr8 is designed to take the heavy lifting out of this, by allowing you to manipulate yaml with a first class data templating language (jsonnet) without all the overhead of similar tools.</description></item><item><title>Applying SOLID principles to Infrastructure as Code</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/solid/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/solid/</guid><description>S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, in the early 2000s.
These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend.
They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily re-factor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.
This talk discusses our options how we can model puppet code while applying the SOLID principles.</description></item><item><title>Break</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/breakafternoon00/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:00:00

I will never buy that JSON is a programming language.
Cloud Formation tries so hard mixing JSON with keywords that runtime become functions saying that it is a maintainable approach.
Helm pushes hard saying that YAML with some parameters that runtime get translated to a variable is a flexible and maintainable approach.
Infrastructure as code means that you are supposed to use a programming language because otherwise, it won&amp;rsquo;t work.</description></item><item><title>Introducing &#39;object-oriented operations&#39; for community-driven infrastructure-as-code</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/objectinfra/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/objectinfra/</guid><description>Infrastructure as code is a proven pattern, and so is open source.

This talk is about bringing those ideas together, to create effective open source communities for operational code on Kubernetes and on traditional machine or cloud environments.
Collaborating on complex infrastructure, and using open source to share the benefits of that collaboration, will enable us all to spend more time focused on the things which are truly different about our challenges and less on the problems we all share.</description></item><item><title>Istio: Control and Observability for Microservices</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/istioobserve/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/istioobserve/</guid><description>Istio is a new open platform to connect, manage, and secure micro-services jointly launched by IBM, Google, and Lyft.

A very large scale stream processing pipeline have been built managing metadata for 100s of thousands of nodes using technologies from Choria.io and NATS.io, this talk will explore the design, performance and potential uses of such a platform.</description></item><item><title>The Unexpected (Infrastructure Management) Journey</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/journey/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/journey/</guid><description>What is it like to start new in infrastructure management land coming from development/qa/release background? - How do you wrap your head into infrastructure as code when all you cared before was if your code compiles? - How do software development techniques translate to infrastructure management?
I started my first job as an operations engineer 18 months ago and I had all of those questions and many more.
Coming from development background the transition into a more ops role and a DevOps team has been a fascinating journey.</description></item><item><title>100 years of infrastructure: A future history</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/keynote1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/keynote1/</guid><description>RFC-1 was published 50 years ago. Infrastructure management emerged as a discrete field two decades later, and devops a decade after that. As we work to realize the full potential of networked computing and the decentralized organizations it enables, what will the next 50 years bring, and what can we do to hurry things along?
In this talk, we’ll touch on some of the roots of current infrastructure management tools and the motivation and computing science theory behind them.</description></item><item><title>CfgMgmtCamp is dead, ...</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/intro00/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/intro00/</guid><description>The opening introduction of #CfgMgmtCamp.

The core idea is to merge the kernel, libraries, and application into a single image binary, operating in a single address space.
This has the potential to improve security, performance, and a few other factors.
For native Unikernel applications, this moves configuration to the build stage.
So how are we supposed to manage these applications?
How should they be configured and deployed?</description></item><item><title>Developing Applications with Kubernetes</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/appkube/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/appkube/</guid><description>Microservices revolutionized the way we look at app development and is now one of the most popular programming architectures.
Now, Docker alongside Kubernetes is changing the way teams look at deployments of these microservices.
Kubernetes provides powerful production-grade orchestration for your &amp;ldquo;Dockerized&amp;rdquo; microservices.
In this workshop, you&amp;rsquo;ll get an overview of Kubernetes, and what it provides for application development.
You&amp;rsquo;ll then go through the process of building and deploying a microservice application on Kubernetes.</description></item><item><title>Everyday OpenStack with Object Oriented Operations</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/objectstack/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/objectstack/</guid><description>In this extended tutorial, led by Mark Shuttleworth and James Troup, you&amp;rsquo;ll see how Canonical manages to operate tens of OpenStack clouds at reasonable scale with a small but focused team.
Operating OpenStack is widely considered to be difficult. Many early implementations have ground to a halt as people struggle with combinatorial complexity and the pace of change. Object-oriented operations enable reuse of ops code in diverse settings and configurations.</description></item><item><title>Foreman Construction Day After-Noon</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/foreman1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/foreman1/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fourth Generation Automation: Uniting Models and Tasks</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/4thgenauto/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/4thgenauto/</guid><description>To borrow a phrase, &amp;ldquo;In the beginning was the command line.&amp;rdquo; Then we had ISConf and CFEngine, and things were good&amp;hellip; for a while.
Puppet and Chef came along, embodying the idea that infrastructure code should behave like application code. More recently, Ansible brought the concept of idempotent resources to imperative workflows, but stops short of modelling in favor of radical simplicity.
Now we&amp;rsquo;re wondering: is it possible to get the best of both worlds?</description></item><item><title>Incident Resolution as Code</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/incidentcode/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/incidentcode/</guid><description>In this talk I will go in details about how we quickly resolve incidents using Prometheus and ansible.
Come and discover how we linked the monitoring, queuing systems and orchestration to do unattended incident management.
One of the main advantages of this is that we can apply technical remediation or mitigation from business metrics, even if things happen at different levels.
All of this working anywhere Prometheus and ansible run, so not only in a kube env, but also in a traditional infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Multi-cloud and on-prem Kubernetes with Object Oriented Operations</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/objectkube/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/objectkube/</guid><description>A deep dive into K8s operations, scaling, upgrades and integration across public clouds, VMware, OpenStack and bare metal, by Mark Shuttleworth and Calvin Hartwell.

modern infrastructure is ever more fluid and dynamic, chaotic and transient.
Likewise, individual engineering roles can no longer be broken down neatly into
software engineers (who write the code) and ops engineers (who deploy the code (and buffer the consequences)).
Many teams have already sailed past an event horizon of complexity and found that their old tools and processes no longer work for them.</description></item><item><title>Rudder on Docker hackathon</title><link>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/rudder/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/wednesday/rudder/</guid><description>Know about Docker, Rudder, or even better both?
